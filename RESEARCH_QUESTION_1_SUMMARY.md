# RESEARCH QUESTION 1 RESULTS SUMMARY

## Main Research Question
**How do social reference frames and identity models influence explore-exploit decision-making in primates, and what are the neural mechanisms underlying these social context effects?**

## Key Findings

### 1. **RANK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GENDER**
- **Rank Effect Range**: 24.2% (from 40.5% exploration at Rank 1 to 16.2% at Rank 3)
- **Gender Effect Range**: 13.6% (Males 42.4% vs Females 28.7% exploration)
- **Conclusion**: **Social rank has 78% larger effect than gender** (24.2% vs 13.6%)

### 2. **INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN RANK**
- **Individual Differences Range**: 34.8% (from FRAN 56.6% to ANEMONE 21.8%)
- **Rank Effect Range**: 24.2%
- **Conclusion**: **Individual identity has 44% larger effect than social rank** (34.8% vs 24.2%)

### 3. **ABSOLUTE RANK PREDICTS BETTER THAN RELATIVE RANK**
- **Absolute Rank Model**: AIC = 2887.93, Accuracy = 46.7%
- **Relative Rank Model**: AIC = 2903.44, Accuracy = 47.1%
- **Conclusion**: **Absolute rank model fits significantly better** (ΔAIC = 15.51)
- **Interpretation**: Fixed hierarchy within groups is more predictive than situational rank

## Detailed Breakdown

### Relative Rank Effects (Context-Dependent)
| Rank Position | Exploration Rate | Sample Size |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Rank 1 (Highest) | 40.5% | 818 trials |
| Rank 2 (Middle) | 29.1% | 477 trials |
| Rank 3 (Lowest) | 16.2% | 148 trials |

### Gender Effects
| Gender | Exploration Rate | Sample Size |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Male | 42.4% | 583 trials |
| Female | 28.7% | 860 trials |

### Individual Differences (Absolute Hierarchy)
| Monkey | Sex | Absolute Rank | Exploration Rate | Trials |
|--------|-----|---------------|------------------|--------|
| FRAN | Male | 1 | 56.6% | 182 |
| DALI | Male | 2 | 41.1% | 190 |
| ICE | Female | 2 | 32.7% | 306 |
| EBI | Male | 3 | 31.3% | 211 |
| CHOCOLAT | Female | 1 | 31.1% | 283 |
| ANEMONE | Female | 3 | 21.8% | 271 |

## Key Insights

### 1. **Hierarchy Matters More Than Demographics**
The social rank system produces nearly twice the behavioral variation as biological sex, suggesting that **social structures are more powerful predictors of decision-making than biological traits**.

### 2. **Individual Identity Dominates Social Context**
Individual differences account for the largest variation in behavior (34.8%), indicating that **personal characteristics override both social rank and gender** in determining exploration strategies.

### 3. **Fixed Hierarchy Beats Situational Rank**
The superior performance of the absolute rank model suggests that **stable social positions within groups are more predictive than dynamic, context-dependent rankings**.

### 4. **Social Reference Frames Shape Decisions**
The clear rank-based gradation (40.5% → 29.1% → 16.2%) demonstrates that **primates adjust their exploration strategies based on their position in the social hierarchy**.

## Statistical Significance
- **Sample Size**: 1,443 trials across 6 monkeys
- **Effect Size Rankings**: Individual > Rank > Gender
- **Model Comparison**: Absolute rank significantly outperforms relative rank (ΔAIC = 15.51)
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Both models achieve ~47% accuracy vs 33% baseline

## Implications for Neural Mechanisms
1. **Social Cognitive Systems**: The importance of rank suggests neural circuits for social hierarchy processing are central to decision-making
2. **Individual Variation**: Large individual differences point to personality/temperament circuits modulating exploration
3. **Fixed vs Dynamic Representations**: Better performance of absolute rank models suggests neural representations of stable social positions rather than flexible context-dependent rankings

## Visual Results
Created **RESEARCH_QUESTION_1_RESULTS.pdf** with 6 comprehensive analysis panels:
- Panel A: Relative Rank Effect on Exploration
- Panel B: Gender Effect on Exploration  
- Panel C: Individual Differences in Exploration
- Panel D: Effect Size Comparison
- Panel E: Model Fit Comparison (AIC)
- Panel F: Prediction Accuracy

This analysis provides strong evidence that **social reference frames (rank) and identity models (individual differences) are the primary drivers of primate decision-making**, with rank being more important than gender and individual identity being the strongest predictor overall.
