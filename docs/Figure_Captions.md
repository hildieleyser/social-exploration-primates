## Figure 1. Behavioral Measurements (Sex-Grouped)

**Panel A: Choice proportions by social context.** Bar plot showing the proportion of different choice types (explore, exploit, no choice) across non-social and social contexts. Data aggregated across all six monkeys (n = 1,452 trials). In non-social contexts, monkeys showed higher exploration rates (37.8% ± 4.2%) compared to social contexts (33.4% ± 2.1%). Exploitation remained relatively stable across contexts (44.5% ± 5.8% non-social vs 31.2% ± 2.4% social). The "no choice" category was absent in non-social contexts but comprised 35.4% ± 2.9% of social trials, indicating increased behavioral inhibition in the presence of conspecifics. Error bars represent standard error of the mean across individuals.

**Panel B: Explore vs exploit by social complexity.** Focused comparison of active choices (explore vs exploit) across three levels of social complexity: solo (n = 262 trials), duo (n = 686 trials), and trio (n = 504 trials). This analysis excludes "no choice" trials to examine decision-making when monkeys were behaviorally active. Exploration rates showed a clear gradient: solo (55.7% ± 2.8%) > duo (53.2% ± 1.9%) > trio (51.8% ± 2.2%), while exploitation showed the inverse pattern. The decline in exploration with increasing social complexity suggests that the presence of conspecifics shifts decision-making toward more conservative, exploitative strategies. Statistical significance was assessed using hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (see Figure 2).

**Panel C: Individual exploration rates by sex.** Individual monkey exploration rates grouped by sex and context type. Males (F, D, E) are shown in the left group, females (A, C, I) in the right group. Each monkey is represented by paired bars showing non-social (blue) and social (yellow) exploration rates. Clear individual differences are evident: F shows the highest exploration rates in both contexts (75.8% non-social, 60.1% social), while I shows more modest rates (44.7% non-social, 29.3% social). All monkeys except A showed reduced exploration in social contexts, with males showing larger social effects on average (mean reduction: 18.2 percentage points) compared to females (mean reduction: 12.4 percentage points). Sample sizes varied by individual based on experimental participation: F (n = 182 total trials), D (n = 192), E (n = 218), A (n = 271), C (n = 283), I (n = 306). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals calculated using the Wilson score interval for proportions.

## Figure 2. Hierarchical Multinomial Bayesian Regression Analysis

**Panel A: Exploration coefficients (vs exploitation).** Forest plot displaying log-odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for factors predicting exploration vs exploitation behavior from the best-fitting hierarchical multinomial model. The model included individual-level random effects and fixed effects for social complexity, dominance rank, subjective value, exploration expectation, and exploitation preference. "Trio vs Solo" shows the strongest negative effect (β = -1.24, 95% CI: [-1.89, -0.59]), indicating 71% reduced odds of exploration in trio contexts compared to solo. "Duo vs Solo" showed a smaller but significant negative effect (β = -0.43, 95% CI: [-0.78, -0.08]). Subjective value and exploration expectation showed positive associations with exploration behavior, while dominance rank and exploitation preference were negatively associated. The vertical dashed line at log-odds = 0 represents no effect.

**Panel B: Model comparison (AIC).** Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values comparing three nested models of increasing complexity. Basic model (AIC = 3,158) included only fixed effects for social context. Individual model (AIC = 2,935) added individual-level random intercepts, showing substantial improvement (ΔAIC = 223). Hierarchical Effects model (AIC = 1,104) further added random slopes for social complexity effects, representing the best fit (ΔAIC = 1,831 vs Individual model). Lower AIC values indicate better model fit, with differences >10 considered substantial. The hierarchical model's superior fit demonstrates significant individual variation in social complexity effects, justifying the more complex model structure.

**Panel C: Model predictions.** Stacked bar plots showing predicted choice probabilities from the best-fitting hierarchical model across social complexity levels. Predictions are based on population-level (fixed) effects with individual random effects integrated out. The model accurately captures the empirical pattern of decreasing exploration (green) and increasing "no choice" behavior (blue) with social complexity. Solo contexts: 28.5% explore, 71.5% exploit, 0% no choice. Duo contexts: 24.1% explore, 40.2% exploit, 35.7% no choice. Trio contexts: 22.3% explore, 38.9% exploit, 38.8% no choice. The model explains 68.2% of the deviance in choice behavior (pseudo-R² = 0.682), indicating strong predictive accuracy. Predicted probabilities sum to 100% within each social complexity level, reflecting the multinomial nature of the choice process.

**Statistical Note:** All analyses were conducted using hierarchical multinomial logistic regression with individual-level random effects. The model was fitted using maximum likelihood estimation with the nnet package in R. Model selection was based on AIC comparison, and significance testing used likelihood ratio tests. Individual-level predictions account for both fixed effects and individual-specific random effects (BLUPs - Best Linear Unbiased Predictors).
