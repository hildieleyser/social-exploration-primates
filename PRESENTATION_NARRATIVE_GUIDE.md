## How Social Context and Identity Shape Primate Choices

---

## **üéØ PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (15-20 minutes)**

### **SLIDE 1: HOOK & SETUP (2 minutes)**
**Title**: "Who Am I in This Moment? How Reference Frames and Identity Models Determine Decision-Making"

**Opening Hook**: 
*"Imagine you're deciding whether to speak up in a meeting. Are you alone with your boss? In a room full of peers? Are you the expert or the newcomer? Your decision isn't just about the idea‚Äîit's about who you are in that social context."*

**Key Message**: Decision-making isn't just individual‚Äîit's fundamentally shaped by:
1. **Reference frames** (social context)
2. **Identity models** (who you think you are)

---

### **SLIDE 2: THE RESEARCH QUESTION (2 minutes)**
**Title**: "Testing Reference Frames and Identity in Primate Decision-Making"

**The Setup**:
- 6 macaque monkeys making explore/exploit/none decisions
- 1,600 behavioral choices across different social contexts
- Systematic manipulation of social reference frames and identity cues

**Key Variables** (Your Y10, Y02, Y03):
- **Y10 (Reference Frame)**: Solo vs Duo vs Trio contexts
- **Y02 (Social Presence)**: Alone vs Partnered
- **Y03 (Identity Status)**: Relative rank position (1-3)

**The Question**: *How do social reference frames and identity models shape the fundamental explore-exploit trade-off?*

---

### **SLIDE 3: REFERENCE FRAMES RESHAPE DECISIONS (4 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_KEY_GRAPHS.pdf` - Graph 1A (Social Context Effect)

**The Story**:
"**Reference frames fundamentally alter decision-making**"

**Key Finding**: 20.8% reduction in exploration from solo ‚Üí trio
- **Solo (no social frame)**: 42.6% exploration - "I can take risks"
- **Duo (dyadic frame)**: 31.8% exploration - "I need to consider one other"  
- **Trio (group frame)**: 21.8% exploration - "I'm part of a complex social system"

**Narrative**: 
*"This isn't just social inhibition‚Äîit's a complete reframing of the decision space. As social complexity increases, the reference frame shifts from 'what's best for me?' to 'what's appropriate given my social context?' The same individual making the same choice becomes fundamentally different depending on their social reference frame."*

**Statistical Power**: p = 4.09 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬π (highly significant)

---

### **SLIDE 4: IDENTITY MODELS DETERMINE BEHAVIOR (4 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_KEY_GRAPHS.pdf` - Graph 1B (Identity Status Effect)

**The Story**:
"**Identity models create behavioral templates**"

**Key Finding**: 24.2% exploration difference across identity status
- **Rank 1 (High Status Identity)**: 37.5% exploration - "I can afford to take risks"
- **Rank 2 (Middle Status Identity)**: 25.6% exploration - "I need to be careful"
- **Rank 3 (Low Status Identity)**: 13.3% exploration - "I can't afford mistakes"

**Narrative**:
*"This is our strongest effect. Identity isn't just self-perception‚Äîit's a behavioral program. High-status individuals have an 'explorer' identity model that permits risk-taking. Low-status individuals have a 'conservator' identity model that prioritizes safety. The same objective choice becomes subjectively different based on 'who am I allowed to be?'"*

**Statistical Power**: Largest single effect in the entire model

---

### **SLIDE 5: IDENTITY INTERSECTION (3 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_KEY_GRAPHS.pdf` - Graph 1C (Sex √ó Hierarchy Interaction)

**The Story**:
"**Multiple identity models interact**"

**Key Findings**:
- **Male + Dominant**: Highest exploration (explorer identity amplified)
- **Female + Subordinate**: Lowest exploration (conservator identity reinforced)
- **Cross-combinations**: Intermediate patterns showing identity conflict/integration

**Narrative**:
*"Identity isn't singular‚Äîwe carry multiple identity models simultaneously. Sex-based identity ('males take risks') intersects with status-based identity ('high status permits risk'). When identities align, effects amplify. When they conflict, we see intermediate behaviors as individuals navigate competing identity demands."*

---

### **SLIDE 6: INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY PROFILES (3 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_KEY_GRAPHS.pdf` - Graph 1D (Individual Profiles)

**The Story**:
"**Personal identity overrides group predictions**"

**Key Finding**: 35% range across individuals despite strong social effects
- **FRAN**: 55.7% exploration - "Risk-taking maverick" identity
- **ANEMONE**: 20.7% exploration - "Cautious conservator" identity

**Narrative**:
*"Here's the fascinating paradox: while social context and status create strong behavioral templates, individual identity models can override these social scripts. FRAN explores more than group membership predicts. ANEMONE explores less. This suggests deeply internalized personal identity models that persist across social contexts‚Äî'this is who I am regardless of the situation.'"*

---

### **SLIDE 7: REFERENCE FRAME SHIFTS (2 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_DECISION_SPACE.pdf` - Graph 2A (Context √ó Rank Interaction)

**The Story**:
"**Reference frames and identity models interact dynamically**"

**Key Finding**: Rank effects change magnitude across social contexts
- Solo context: Rank differences moderate
- Group context: Rank differences amplified

**Narrative**:
*"This is where it gets really interesting. Reference frames don't just add to identity effects‚Äîthey modulate them. In solo contexts, identity matters less because there's no social comparison. In group contexts, identity becomes hyper-relevant because social comparison is explicit. The reference frame determines how much your identity model matters."*

---

### **SLIDE 8: MODEL INTEGRATION (2 minutes)**
**Graph to Show**: `PRESENTATION_DECISION_SPACE.pdf` - Graph 2D (Model Performance)

**The Story**:
"**Reference frames + identity models = powerful prediction**"

**Key Finding**: 88.1% accuracy vs 36.9% baseline (51% improvement)

**Statistical Validation**:
- Cross-validated (no overfitting)
- All effects p < 0.001
- Large effect sizes (11-24% behavioral differences)

**Narrative**:
*"When we integrate reference frames and identity models, we can predict primate decision-making with remarkable accuracy. This isn't just statistical significance‚Äîit's practical significance. Understanding someone's social reference frame and identity model tells us more about their behavior than individual preferences alone."*

## **üí¨ KEY TALKING POINTS**

### **Reference Frames**:
- "Social context isn't just background‚Äîit's the lens through which decisions are made"
- "The same choice becomes a different choice in different social reference frames"
- "From 'what do I want?' to 'what's appropriate given who's watching?'"

### **Identity Models**:
- "Identity isn't just self-concept‚Äîit's a behavioral program"
- "High status = 'I'm allowed to explore'; Low status = 'I must be careful'"
- "The strongest predictor isn't personality‚Äîit's identity position"

### **Integration**:
- "Reference frames determine when identity matters most"
- "Multiple identities create behavioral complexity, not confusion"
- "Personal identity can override social scripts"

## **üî¨ SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS**

### **For Decision Science**:
- Individual choice models miss social embedding
- Context effects aren't noise‚Äîthey're systematic reference frame shifts
- Identity-based prediction outperforms preference-based prediction

### **For Social Psychology**:
- Identity effects are quantifiable and large (24% behavioral range)
- Multiple identity intersection creates predictable patterns
- Social context modulates identity salience

### **For Organizational Behavior**:
- Team composition changes individual decision-making reference frames
- Status differences create systematic behavioral differences
- Individual differences persist within social constraints

## **‚ùì ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

**Q**: "How do we know this applies to humans?"
**A**: "Primate social cognition shares fundamental mechanisms with humans. The reference frame and identity model concepts translate directly to human organizational and social contexts."

**Q**: "What about individual differences?"
**A**: "Individual differences are huge‚Äî35% range‚Äîbut they operate within social constraints. Personal identity models can override but don't eliminate social effects."

**Q**: "Is this just social conformity?"
**A**: "No‚Äîit's more sophisticated. It's dynamic identity activation based on social reference frames. The same individual can be explorer or conservator depending on social context and identity salience."

## **üéØ CLOSING MESSAGE (1 minute)**

**"The Big Picture"**:
*"Decision-making isn't individual‚Äîit's social, contextual, and identity-based. When we understand someone's reference frame ('what's the social context?') and identity model ('who am I in this context?'), we can predict their choices with remarkable accuracy. This has profound implications for how we think about choice, behavior change, and social influence."*

**Call to Action**: 
*"Next time you're trying to understand or predict someone's decision, don't just ask 'what do they want?'‚Äîask 'what's their social reference frame?' and 'which identity model is active?' The answer will transform your understanding of human behavior."*
