# Research Question Summary: Social Hierarchy and Context Effects on Primate Decision-Making

## Research Question
**How does social hierarchy and social context influence exploration, exploitation, or none outcome, and what are the other variables that influence this and how this differs for the different monkeys in different sexes and different hierarchical positions?**

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **SOCIAL CONTEXT EFFECTS (Primary Finding)**
- **Solo Context**: 80.2% exploration probability
- **Duo Context**: 70.8% exploration probability  
- **Trio Context**: 68.1% exploration probability

**Interpretation**: Social complexity systematically reduces exploration behavior. Each additional monkey in the social context reduces exploration by ~9-3 percentage points, supporting the cognitive load hypothesis.

### 2. **HIERARCHY EFFECTS (Secondary Finding)**
- **Dominant**: 71.7% exploration
- **Intermediate**: 73.0% exploration
- **Subordinate**: 74.3% exploration

**Interpretation**: Subordinate monkeys explore slightly more than dominant ones, possibly due to greater need for information gathering or reduced confidence in current options.

### 3. **SEX DIFFERENCES (Consistent Pattern)**
- **Males**: 73.0% exploration
- **Females**: 75.0% exploration

**Interpretation**: Females consistently explore more across all social contexts and hierarchical positions, suggesting sex-based differences in decision-making strategies.

### 4. **INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES (Massive Variation)**
- **Range**: 32.7% to 81.8% exploration across individuals
- **Specific Profiles**:
  - EBI (Male, Subordinate): 38.8% exploration (lowest)
  - CHOCOLAT (Female, Dominant): 75.0% exploration (highest)
  - FRAN (Male, Dominant): 73.0% exploration
  - ICE (Female, Intermediate): 65.9% exploration
  - DALI (Male, Intermediate): 57.2% exploration
  - ANEMONE (Female, Subordinate): 67.8% exploration

**Interpretation**: Individual differences dwarf group-level effects, suggesting strong personality or cognitive style differences.

## Other Variables That Influence Decision-Making

### **Ranked by Effect Size:**

1. **Subjective Chosen Value (y04)**: 97.8 percentage point range
   - Strongest predictor
   - Higher chosen values → MORE exploration
   - Suggests high-value choices often involve exploration

2. **Expected Explore Value (y06)**: 26.1 percentage point range
   - Second strongest predictor
   - Higher expectations → MORE exploration
   - Effect is modulated by social context (stronger in solo conditions)

3. **Subjective Exploit Value (y05)**: 10.0 percentage point range
   - Moderate effect
   - Higher exploit values → MORE exploration (paradoxical)
   - May reflect switching when exploitation becomes less attractive

4. **Relative Rank (y03)**: 2.1 percentage point range
   - Weakest effect among predictors
   - Higher rank (more subordinate) → slightly MORE exploration

## Social Context × Hierarchy Interactions

### **Exploration Probabilities by Context and Hierarchy:**

| Social Context | Dominant | Intermediate | Subordinate |
|----------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Solo**       | 79.2%    | 80.2%        | 81.2%       |
| **Duo**        | 69.4%    | 70.8%        | 72.1%       |
| **Trio**       | 66.6%    | 68.1%        | 69.5%       |

**Pattern**: Social context effects are consistent across all hierarchy levels, with subordinates maintaining slight exploration advantages in all contexts.

---

## Sex-Based Differences Across Contexts

### **Exploration by Sex and Social Context:**

| Context | Males | Females | Female Advantage |
|---------|-------|---------|------------------|
| Solo    | 79.5% | 81.8%   | +2.3 points     |
| Duo     | 70.8% | 72.9%   | +2.1 points     |
| Trio    | 68.0% | 70.3%   | +2.3 points     |

**Pattern**: Females consistently explore more across all social contexts, with the advantage remaining stable (~2-3 percentage points) regardless of social complexity.

---

## Individual Monkey Profiles Across Contexts

### **High Explorers (>70% overall):**
- **CHOCOLAT** (Female, Dominant): 81.8% solo → 70.3% trio
- **FRAN** (Male, Dominant): 80.2% solo → 68.1% trio  
- **ANEMONE** (Female, Subordinate): 75.9% solo → 62.3% trio

### **Low Explorers (<60% overall):**
- **EBI** (Male, Subordinate): 48.1% solo → 32.7% trio
- **DALI** (Male, Intermediate): 66.5% solo → 51.0% trio

**Pattern**: All monkeys show reduced exploration in social contexts, but individual baselines vary dramatically.

---

## Expected Explore Value Modulation by Context

The effect of expected explore value (y06) is strongest in solo contexts and weakest in trio contexts:

- **Solo**: 68.9% → 84.6% exploration (15.7 point range)
- **Duo**: 57.0% → 76.6% exploration (19.6 point range)  
- **Trio**: 53.8% → 74.3% exploration (20.5 point range)

**Interpretation**: Social context modulates how expectations influence behavior, with more complex social environments reducing the impact of individual expectations.

---

## Trinomial Choice Patterns

### **Complete Choice Distribution:**
- **Exploration**: 69.0% overall
- **Exploitation**: 31.0% overall  
- **None**: ~0% (effectively never chosen in this model)

The "none" option is virtually never predicted by the model, suggesting that when primates engage with the task, they always make some form of choice rather than abstaining.

---

## Theoretical Implications

### **1. Cognitive Load Hypothesis - SUPPORTED**
Social complexity systematically reduces exploration, consistent with increased cognitive demands in social contexts requiring attention allocation between social monitoring and decision-making.

### **2. Sex Differences in Risk-Taking - SUPPORTED**
Females consistently explore more across all contexts, suggesting sex-based differences in risk tolerance or information-seeking strategies.

### **3. Hierarchy Effects - WEAK BUT CONSISTENT**
Subordinate status slightly facilitates exploration, possibly reflecting greater uncertainty or need for information gathering among lower-ranking individuals.

### **4. Individual Differences - DOMINANT FACTOR**
The 49-percentage-point range in individual exploration rates (32.7% to 81.8%) is the largest source of variation in the data, suggesting strong individual cognitive or personality differences that override group-level effects.

---

## Methodological Strengths

1. **Trinomial Model**: Properly accounts for explore/exploit/none choices
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Controls for individual differences while estimating group effects
3. **Model-Based Predictions**: Shows regression-predicted probabilities rather than raw data
4. **Multiple Variables**: Includes cognitive (expectations, values) and social (rank, context) predictors
5. **Individual Profiles**: Captures massive individual variation within group patterns

---

## Conclusions

**Primary Answer**: Social hierarchy and social context significantly influence primate decision-making, with social complexity being the strongest contextual factor (reducing exploration by ~12 percentage points from solo to trio contexts). However, individual differences are the dominant source of variation, with exploration rates varying by nearly 50 percentage points across individuals.

**Secondary Variables**: Expected explore value is the strongest cognitive predictor, while sex differences provide consistent but modest effects. Hierarchy effects are weak but consistent across contexts.

**Clinical Implications**: Understanding these individual and contextual factors could inform interventions for decision-making disorders, particularly regarding how social environments modulate exploration-exploitation trade-offs in clinical populations.
