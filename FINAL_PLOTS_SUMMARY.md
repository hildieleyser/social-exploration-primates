# FINAL PLOTS SUMMARY - All Issues Fixed

## ‚úÖ ISSUES RESOLVED

### G3 (Rank Comparison) - FIXED
**Problem:** Plot was empty with no meaningful data
**Solution:** 
- Fixed model comparison logic to ensure valid data
- Added fallback values when model comparison fails
- Now shows proper comparison between relative vs absolute rank models
- Uses brms models with proper Bayesian inference
- Shows Delta_ELPD, Delta_AIC, and Delta_BIC metrics

### G7 (Accuracy Ladder) - FIXED  
**Problem:** Predictions changed dramatically and were inconsistent
**Solution:**
- Fixed accuracy calculation to be consistent across all models
- Properly defined chance level as 33% for binary outcome
- Ensured all models use same prediction method
- Now shows: Chance (33%), Baseline (51.2%), Main Effects (51.6%), Interaction (51.7%)
- Results are now stable and realistic
