# Figure 2: Hierarchical Multinomial Bayesian Regression Analysis of Social Context Effects on Exploration-Exploitation Behavior

## Detailed Caption

**Figure 2. Hierarchical multinomial Bayesian regression analysis reveals social context effects on exploration-exploitation decisions in rhesus macaques.** 

**(A) Experimental design and outcome frequencies.** Left: Experimental paradigm showing three social contexts (solo, duo, trio) with trial counts per condition (solo: n=483, duo: n=484, trio: n=484 trials). Right: Raw outcome frequencies across social contexts showing counts for each behavioral choice (Exploit: blue, Explore: yellow, None: grey). Total dataset comprised 1,451 trials from 6 rhesus macaques (3 males: FRAN, DALI, EBI; 3 females: ANEMONE, CHOCOLAT, ICE) across 88 experimental blocks.

**(B) Fixed-effect coefficients.** Forest plots showing posterior distributions of fixed-effect coefficients from the hierarchical multinomial model, with thick lines representing 50% credible intervals and thin lines representing 95% credible intervals. Left facet shows coefficients for Explore vs. Exploit (reference), right facet shows coefficients for None vs. Exploit. Secondary x-axis displays odds ratios (exp(coefficient)). Predictors include: Social Complexity (numeric coding of social context: 1=solo, 2=duo, 3=trio), Expected Explore (z-scored expected exploration value), Subjective Exploit (z-scored subjective exploitation value), Chosen Value (z-scored subjective value of chosen option), and Dominance Rank (z-scored absolute rank within group). Posterior distributions generated from 1,000 draws using normal approximation to likelihood with model-derived standard errors.

**(C) Random-effect spread.** Caterpillar plots showing individual-level random intercepts for each monkey, with 95% credible intervals. Individuals ordered by sex (males: F, D, E in orange; females: C, I, A in pink) and labeled with initials and sex symbols (♂/♀). ANEMONE (A) serves as the reference level with effect = 0. Random effects capture individual differences in baseline tendencies after accounting for all fixed effects. Faceted by outcome type (Explore vs. Exploit, None vs. Exploit).

**(D) Posterior-predictive check.** Model validation comparing observed outcome frequencies (colored points) to posterior-predictive distributions (boxplots) across social contexts. Boxplots show predicted frequency distributions from 100 posterior-predictive simulations, with observed data points overlaid using position dodge. Good model fit indicated by observed values falling within predicted distributions. Colors correspond to outcomes (Exploit: blue, Explore: yellow, None: grey).

**(E) Model comparison.** Information criteria comparison showing ΔAIC and ΔBIC values relative to the best-fitting model. Three models compared: Null (intercept-only), Fixed (fixed effects only), and Hierarchical (fixed + random effects). Hierarchical model achieves best fit (Δ = 0.0 for both metrics), with Fixed model showing moderate support (ΔAIC = 13.1, ΔBIC = 29.1) and Null model showing poor fit (ΔAIC = 2119.4, ΔBIC = 2104.2). Model comparison based on maximum likelihood estimation.

**Statistical Details:** The hierarchical multinomial logistic regression model was fitted using maximum likelihood estimation with the `nnet` package in R. The model equation is: logit(P(outcome=k|X)) = β₀ₖ + β₁ₖ×social_complexity + β₂ₖ×expected_explore_z + β₃ₖ×subjective_exploit_z + β₄ₖ×chosen_value_z + β₅ₖ×rank_z + αᵢₖ, where k ∈ {Explore, None} with Exploit as reference, and αᵢₖ represents individual-specific random intercepts. Posterior inference approximated using multivariate normal distribution centered at maximum likelihood estimates with covariance matrix derived from observed Fisher information. All continuous predictors were z-scored (mean = 0, SD = 1) for interpretability. Sample sizes: 1,451 trials, 6 individuals, 88 blocks. Effect sizes interpretable as log-odds ratios, with odds ratios > 1 indicating increased probability relative to reference category.

**Data Availability:** Raw behavioral data includes trial-by-trial choices, block structure, social context manipulations, and individual characteristics. Missing data handled via complete case analysis after filtering for valid trials (TRIAL_TYPE == "OIT_RE"). No imputation performed. All analyses conducted in R version 3.6.3 with reproducible code available.

**Color Scheme:** Color-blind safe palette used throughout. Social contexts: solo (blue), duo (yellow), trio (grey). Outcomes: Exploit (blue), Explore (yellow), None (grey). Individual sex: males (orange), females (pink). All colors selected to avoid conflicts between different grouping variables and ensure accessibility.
