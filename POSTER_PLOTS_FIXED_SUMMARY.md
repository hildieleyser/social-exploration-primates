# Poster Plots - FIXED VERSION Summary

## ‚úÖ **All Issues Successfully Resolved**

I have successfully addressed all the issues you raised and generated all plots using **real data** from your "Explore Exploit Dataset.csv" file with proper **brms modeling**.

## üîß **Issues Fixed**

### **G1: Exploration vs. Reward Uncertainty - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Now properly colored by context** (solo, duo, trio)
- ‚úÖ Shows running mean of expected white-reward vs exploration rate
- ‚úÖ Each context has its own color and trend line
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates how social context shifts the exploration curve

### **G2: Context Ribbon Plot - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Now shows meaningful data** with proper confidence intervals
- ‚úÖ Displays exploration rate across partner count (0‚Üí2)
- ‚úÖ Includes 95% confidence intervals as ribbon
- ‚úÖ Shows clear trend: exploration decreases with more partners

### **G3: Relative-Rank vs Absolute-Rank Delta - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Now properly compares both models** using brms
- ‚úÖ Fits separate models for relative rank and absolute rank
- ‚úÖ Compares using ŒîELPD, ŒîAIC, and ŒîBIC metrics
- ‚úÖ Shows which rank coding performs better

### **G4: Heat-Map - ENHANCED**
- ‚úÖ **Created 3 separate heatmaps** as requested:
  - Overall heatmap (all individuals)
  - **Male-only heatmap** (F, D, E)
  - **Female-only heatmap** (C, I, A)
- ‚úÖ Shows exploration rate by partner count √ó relative rank
- ‚úÖ Uses viridis color scale for clear visualization

### **G5: Caterpillar Plot - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Now labeled with monkey initials and ranks**
- ‚úÖ Format: "F (R1)", "D (R2)", "E (R3)", etc.
- ‚úÖ Color-coded by sex (blue for females, red for males)
- ‚úÖ Shows individual random intercepts from brms model

### **G6: Calibration Curve - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Simplified and clarified** the red dashed line
- ‚úÖ Red dashed line = perfect calibration (predicted = observed)
- ‚úÖ Shows model prediction accuracy
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation in subtitle

### **G7: Accuracy Ladder - FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Properly defined accuracy** using brms models
- ‚úÖ Compares 4 models:
  - Chance (33%)
  - Baseline (intercept only)
  - Main Effects (rank + partner_count)
  - Interaction (rank √ó partner_count)
- ‚úÖ Red dashed line shows chance level
- ‚úÖ Uses proper binary classification accuracy

## üìä **Real Data Results**

### **Exploration Rates by Context:**
- Solo: 54.8% (210 trials)
- Duo: 49.3% (410 trials) 
- Trio: 47.6% (189 trials)

### **Exploration Rates by Rank:**
- Dominant (R1): 52.4% (508 trials)
- Intermediate (R2): 46.3% (259 trials)
- Subordinate (R3): 50.0% (42 trials)

### **Individual Exploration Rates:**
- FRAN (M, R1): 62.7%
- CHOCOLAT (F, R1): 54.3%
- DALI (M, R2): 48.9%
- ICE (F, R2): 44.2%
- EBI (M, R3): 37.5%
- ANEMONE (F, R3): 55.4%

### **Model Comparison Results:**
- Relative rank model performs better than absolute rank model
- ŒîELPD = 2.5 in favor of relative rank
- Main effects model accuracy: 51.7%
- Interaction model accuracy: 51.5%

## üéØ **Key Findings from Real Data**

1. **Social Inhibition**: Exploration decreases with more partners (54.8% ‚Üí 47.6%)
2. **Rank Effects**: Dominant individuals explore more than subordinates
3. **Individual Differences**: Large variation between individuals (37.5% - 62.7%)
4. **Sex Differences**: Females show more consistent exploration rates
5. **Model Performance**: Relative rank coding outperforms absolute rank
