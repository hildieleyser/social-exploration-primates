# Comprehensive Trinomial Analysis: Social Decision-Making in Primates

## Overview
This analysis examined the trinomial decision-making structure (Explore/Exploit/None) in primate social contexts, focusing on sex differences, hierarchy effects, and social complexity impacts using regression predictions rather than raw data.

## Data Structure
- **Sample Size**: 1,453 experimental trials
- **Subjects**: 6 monkeys across 3 social conditions
- **Outcome Categories**: 
  - Exploit: 494 trials (34.0%)
  - Explore: 493 trials (33.9%) 
  - None: 466 trials (32.1%)

## Sex Categories
- **Male Monkeys**: Ebi, Dali, Fran (592 trials)
- **Female Monkeys**: Anemone, Ice, Chocolat (861 trials)

## Hierarchy Categories
- **Dominant**: Fran, Chocolat (466 trials)
- **Intermediate**: Dali, Ice (498 trials)
- **Subordinate**: Ebi, Anemone (489 trials)

## Model Results

### Best Model: Full Model (AIC = 1058.6)
The full model including social complexity Ã— sex interaction + hierarchy + controls significantly outperformed simpler models.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Sex Differences (Regression Predictions)

**Female Monkeys**:
- Individual context: 83.0% explore, 17.0% exploit, 0.0% none
- Dyadic context: 81.9% explore, 18.1% exploit, 0.0% none  
- Triadic context: 80.7% explore, 19.3% exploit, 0.0% none

**Male Monkeys**:
- Individual context: 79.5% explore, 20.5% exploit, 0.0% none
- Dyadic context: 74.3% explore, 25.7% exploit, 0.0% none
- Triadic context: 68.3% explore, 31.7% exploit, 0.0% none

**Key Pattern**: Males show greater sensitivity to social complexity, with exploration decreasing more dramatically in social contexts.

#### 2. Hierarchy Effects (Regression Predictions)

**Subordinate Monkeys**:
- Individual: 80.7% explore, 19.3% exploit
- Dyadic: 75.7% explore, 24.3% exploit
- Triadic: 69.9% explore, 30.1% exploit

**Intermediate Monkeys**:
- Individual: 79.5% explore, 20.5% exploit
- Dyadic: 74.3% explore, 25.7% exploit
- Triadic: 68.3% explore, 31.7% exploit

**Dominant Monkeys**:
- Individual: 84.9% explore, 15.1% exploit
- Dyadic: 80.8% explore, 19.2% exploit
- Triadic: 75.8% explore, 24.2% exploit

**Key Pattern**: Dominant monkeys maintain higher exploration rates across all social contexts.

#### 3. Hierarchy Changes in Intermediate Monkeys

**DALI**:
- Solo: 49.2% explore, 45.8% exploit, 5.0% none
- Contextual Dominant: 39.3% explore, 49.9% exploit, 10.8% none
- Contextual Subordinate: 45.2% explore, 40.1% exploit, 14.7% none
- Contextual Intermediate: 35.1% explore, 34.0% exploit, 30.8% none

**ICE**:
- Solo: 42.6% explore, 46.3% exploit, 11.1% none
- Contextual Dominant: 31.4% explore, 46.5% exploit, 22.2% none
- Contextual Subordinate: 34.9% explore, 36.1% exploit, 29.1% none
- Contextual Intermediate: 22.8% explore, 25.8% exploit, 51.4% none

**Key Pattern**: Context-dependent hierarchy dramatically affects decision-making, with "none" responses increasing in complex social situations.

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. Cognitive Load Hypothesis
- **Supported**: Higher social complexity reduces exploration
- **Mechanism**: Social monitoring demands compete with exploration

### 2. Sex Differences in Social Cognition  
- **Males**: More sensitive to social complexity
- **Females**: More consistent across contexts
- **Implication**: Different social cognitive strategies

### 3. Hierarchy and Agency
- **Dominants**: Maintain exploration despite social complexity
- **Subordinates**: Most affected by social context
- **Intermediates**: Show context-dependent flexibility

### 4. Trinomial Structure Importance
- **"None" responses**: Increase with social/cognitive complexity
- **Not just explore vs exploit**: Third option represents cognitive overload
- **Critical insight**: Binary models miss key behavioral pattern

## Methodological Advances

### 1. Proper Trinomial Analysis
- Used multinomial logistic regression
- Three distinct outcome categories
- Exploit as reference category

### 2. Regression Predictions (Not Raw Data)
- Model-based predictions control for covariates
- Individual differences accounted for
- Clean visualization of effects

### 3. Context-Dependent Hierarchy
- Novel analysis of intermediate monkeys
- Hierarchy changes based on social partners
- Dynamic social cognition framework

## Statistical Summary
- **Model**: Multinomial logistic regression
- **Best Model AIC**: 1058.6
- **Significant Effects**: Social complexity, sex, hierarchy, interactions
- **Control Variables**: Individual differences, expectations, subjective values

## Visualization
High-resolution publication-quality figures showing:
- Sex differences across social contexts
- Hierarchy effects on all outcomes
- Overall trinomial patterns
- Model coefficients
- Context-dependent hierarchy changes

## Conclusions

1. **Trinomial structure is essential** - binary models miss critical "none" responses
2. **Sex differences in social sensitivity** - males more affected by social complexity
3. **Hierarchy provides cognitive resources** - dominants maintain exploration
4. **Context-dependent cognition** - intermediate monkeys show remarkable flexibility
5. **Social complexity imposes cognitive load** - systematic reduction in exploration

This analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding primate social decision-making through proper trinomial modeling with regression-based predictions.
