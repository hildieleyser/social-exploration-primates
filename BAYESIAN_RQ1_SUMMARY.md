# BAYESIAN RESEARCH QUESTION 1 RESULTS

## 🏆 WINNER: RELATIVE RANK MODEL (99.8% vs 0.2%)

### Key Findings:
1. **RANK > GENDER**: 24.2% vs 13.6% effect size
2. **INDIVIDUAL > RANK**: 34.8% vs 24.2% effect size  
3. **RELATIVE > ABSOLUTE**: 499:1 odds ratio

### Bayesian Evidence:
- LOO Cross-Validation: ELPD difference = -6.4 ± 3.0
- Model Weight: Relative 99.8%, Absolute 0.2%
- All Rhat = 1.00 (perfect convergence)

### Conclusion:
Context-dependent identity trumps fixed characteristics in primate decision-making.
